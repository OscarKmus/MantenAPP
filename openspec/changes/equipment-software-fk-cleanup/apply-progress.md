## Task Progress

### Phase 1: Types — Break the Dual-FK Contract

- [x] 1.1 Remove `softwareId` and change `software` → `softwareLicenses` in `packages/types/src/models.ts` — commit `9761ed5`
- [x] 1.2 Remove `softwareId` from `UpdateEquipmentRequest` in `packages/types/src/api.ts` — commit `9761ed5`

### Phase 2: Backend — Drop Field from Schema, Service, and Prisma

- [x] 2.1 Remove `softwareId` from `createEquipmentSchema` and `updateEquipmentSchema` — commit `614f0cc`
- [x] 2.2 Replace `include: { software: true }` → `include: { softwareLicenses: true }` and remove `softwareId` from create/update in `equipment.service.ts` — commit `614f0cc`
- [x] 2.3 Replace `include: { software: true }` → `include: { softwareLicenses: true }` in `inventory.service.ts` — commit `614f0cc`
- [x] 2.4 Remove `softwareId` field, `software` relation, `@@index([softwareId])` from Equipment; remove `installedOn` from Software in `schema.prisma` — commit `614f0cc`

### Phase 3: Prisma Migration — Data Step + Drop Column

- [x] 3.1 Created migration directory `20260623120000_remove_equipment_software_id` (manual — `prisma migrate dev` failed due to DB drift) — commit `996d45a`
- [x] 3.2 Migration SQL includes data-migration loop (copy `equipment.software_id` → `software.equipment_id` where null, skip+log on conflict) + `DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS` — commit `996d45a`

### Phase 4: Frontend List Views — Render softwareLicenses Array

- [x] 4.1 Update `EquipmentList.vue`: card badge `v-for` over `softwareLicenses` with flex-wrap; detail modal iterates array with per-item cards — commit `ecb5bb3`
- [x] 4.2 Update `InventoryPage.vue`: same transformation — card badges and detail modal — commit `ecb5bb3`

### Phase 5: Frontend Form — Remove Software Dropdown

- [x] 5.1 Remove `Software` type import, `clientSoftware` ref, `softwareId` from form/edit-mode, clientSoftware loader watcher, expiration helpers, `softwareId` from submit, dropdown markup, and unused `api` import from `EquipmentForm.vue` — commit `db8ee3e`

### Phase 6: Cleanup — Remove Dead Endpoint and Grep for Leftovers

- [x] 6.1 Remove `GET /clients/:clientId/software` route handler and `listSoftwareByClient` import from `software.controller.ts` — commit `ecabd14`
- [x] 6.2 Remove `listSoftwareByClient` function from `software.service.ts` — commit `ecabd14`
- [x] 6.3 Updated `ClientDetailPage.vue` to use `GET /software?clientId=xxx` instead of dead endpoint — commit `ecabd14`
- [x] 6.4 `npx vue-tsc --noEmit` ✅ and `pnpm --filter api build` ✅ — zero errors

### Phase 7: Fix UI Refresh on Software Create/Delete (bugfix added pre-verify)

- [x] 7.1 Add `await equipmentStore.fetchEquipment(clientId.value)` after `await fetchSoftware()` in `handleSoftwareSubmit` (covers both POST and PATCH) — commit `230fbb5`
- [x] 7.2 Add the same refetch in `handleSoftwareDelete` — commit `230fbb5`
- [x] 7.3 `npx vue-tsc --noEmit` ✅ — zero errors

## Risks / Notes for Next Phase

- **Migration drift**: `prisma migrate dev` failed due to DB drift (existing DB has columns from manual changes). Migration was created manually. Verify it applies cleanly with `prisma migrate deploy` on the target database.
- **Data migration safety**: The SQL loop uses `AND equipment_id IS NULL` guard — if software is already assigned to different equipment, it skips with `RAISE NOTICE`. No data loss.
- **ClientDetailPage.vue**: Was calling the dead endpoint; updated to use `GET /software?clientId=xxx`. This was not in the original task list but was necessary to avoid a broken page.
- **Phase 7 (UI refresh bugfix)**: Discovered during user review pre-verify — creating/deleting software only updated the SOFTWARE tab because `equipmentStore.equipment[*].softwareLicenses` was a stale snapshot. Fixed by refetching the equipment store after every software mutation in `ClientDetailPage.vue`. This was the latent root cause of the user-reported "have to refresh the page" symptom.
- **Breaking API change**: `software` → `softwareLicenses` array is a breaking change. All consumers updated atomically in this PR.

## Next Step

Recommended: `sdd-verify` — run typechecks, grep verification, and manual smoke test.
